\usage{
retrieve_column_names(data, target_columns)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{the input data. It can also be a modified data generated in
intermediate cleaning operations.}

\item{target_columns}{a vector of target column names}
}
\value{
a vector of column names to be used for the target cleaning
operations

\description{
When several performing data cleaning operations using the \code{clean_data()}
function, the input column names might be altered by after the column names
cleaning. As a consequence of this, some cleaning operations will fail due to
the column names mismatch. This function is provided to anticipate on this
scenario, hence providing continuity between the cleaning operations.
