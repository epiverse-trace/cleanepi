## Concept and motivation

In this document, we will outline the design decisions that have steered the development strategies of the {cleanepi} R package, along with the rationale behind each decision and the potential advantages and disadvantages associated with them.

Data cleaning is an important phase for ensuring the efficacy of downstream analysis. The procedures entailed in the cleaning process may differ based on the data type and research objectives. Nonetheless, certain steps can be applied universally across diverse data types, irrespective of their origin.

## Design decisions

The {cleanepi} R package is designed to offer functional programming-style data cleansing tasks. To streamline the organization of data cleaning operations, we have categorized them into distinct groups referred to as **modules**. These modules are based on overarching goals derived from commonly anticipated data cleaning procedures. Each module features a primary function along with additional helper functions tailored to accomplish specific tasks. It's important to note that, except for few cases where the outcome a helper function can impact on the cleaning task, only the main function of each module will be exported. This deliberate choice empowers users to execute individual cleaning tasks as needed, enhancing flexibility and usability.

```{r echo=FALSE, comment="Figure1"}
knitr::include_graphics(file.path("..", "man", "figures",
                                  "cleanepi_design_diagram.drawio.png"))
```

At the core of {cleanepi}, the pivotal function `clean_data()` serves as a wrapper encapsulating all the modules, as illustrated in the figure above. This function is intended to be the primary entry point for users seeking to cleanse their data. It performs the cleaning operations as requested by the user through the set of parameters that need to be explicitly defined. Furthermore, multiple cleaning operations can be performed sequentially using the “pipe” operators (`|>` or `%>%`).
In addition, this package also has two surrogate functions:

1. `scan_data()`: This function enables users to assess the data types present in each column of their dataset.
2. `print_report()`: By utilizing this function, users can visualize the report generated from each applied cleaning task, facilitating transparency and understanding of the data cleaning process.

## Scope

{cleanepi} is an R package crafted to clean, curate, and standardize tabular datasets, with a particular focus on epidemiological data. In the architecture of {cleanepi}, the data cleaning operations are categorized into modules, each provides a specific data cleaning task. The modules in the current version of {cleanepi} encompass the:

- standardization of column names,
- detection and removal of duplicates,
- replacement of missing values with `NA`,
- standardization of subject IDs,
- standardization of date values,
- replacement of existing values with predefined ones (dictionary based substitutions),
- conversion of values when necessary,
- verification of the sequence order of date-events, and
- transformation of selected columns.

By compartmentalizing these operations into modules, {cleanepi} offers users a systematic and adaptable framework to address diverse data cleaning needs, especially within the realm of epidemiological datasets. 

 

## Input

The primary functions of the modules, as well as the core function `clean_data()`, accept input in the form of a `data.frame` or `linelist`. This offers flexibility for users regarding where they want to position {cleanepi} within the R package ecosystem for epidemic analysis pipelines, either to clean data before or after converting it to a `linelist`.

In addition to the target dataset, the core function `clean_data()` accepts a `list` of operations to be executed on the dataset. It subsequently invokes the primary functions specified for each module. 


## Output

Both the primary functions of the modules and the core function `clean_data()` return an object of type `data.frame` or `linelist`, depending on the type of the input dataset. The report generated from all cleaning tasks is attached to this object as an attribute, which can be accessed using the `attr()` function in base R.


### Modules in {cleanepi}
