## Concept and motivation

In this document, we will outline the design decisions that have steered the development strategies of the {cleanepi} R package, along with the rationale behind each decision and the potential advantages and disadvantages associated with them.

Data cleaning is an important phase for ensuring the efficacy of downstream analysis. The procedures entailed in the cleaning process may differ based on the data type and research objectives. Nonetheless, certain steps can be applied universally across diverse data types, irrespective of their origin.

## Design decisions

The {cleanepi} R package is designed to offer functional programming-style data cleansing tasks. To streamline the organization of data cleaning operations, we have categorized them into distinct groups referred to as **modules**. These modules are based on overarching goals derived from commonly anticipated data cleaning procedures. Each module features a primary function along with additional helper functions tailored to accomplish specific tasks. It's important to note that only the main function of each module will be exported. This deliberate choice empowers users to execute individual cleaning tasks as needed, enhancing flexibility and usability.

```

At the core of {cleanepi}, the pivotal function `clean_data()` serves as a wrapper encapsulating all the modules, as illustrated in Figure @fig:1. This function is intended to be the primary entry point for users seeking to cleanse their data. We have categorized cleaning actions into two main types: **implicit** and **explicit**. Implicit actions are executed regardless of user specifications, while explicit actions are performed only upon user request.

In addition to `clean_data()`, we will incorporate two surrogate functions:

1. `scan_data()`: This function enables users to assess the data types present in each column of their dataset.
2. `print_report()`: By utilizing this function, users can visualize the report generated from each applied cleaning task, facilitating transparency and understanding of the data cleaning process.

## Scope

{cleanepi} is an R package meticulously crafted to cleanse, curate, and standardize tabular datasets, with a particular focus on epidemiological data. At its core lies the primary function `clean_data()`, which accepts as input the target dataset in the form of a `data.frame` or `linelist` object, along with a `list` of operations to be executed on the dataset.

In the architecture of {cleanepi}, these operations are translated into modules, each catering to specific data cleaning tasks. The modules in the current version of {cleanepi} encompass:

- Standardization of column names,
- Removal of duplicates,
- Replacement of missing values with `NA`,
- Standardization of subject IDs,
- Standardization of date values,
- Replacement of existing values with predefined ones (Dictionary based substitution),
- Conversion of values when necessary,
- Verification of the sequence of date-events, and
- Transformation of select columns.

By compartmentalizing these operations into modules, {cleanepi} offers users a systematic and adaptable framework to address diverse data cleaning needs, especially within the realm of epidemiological datasets.

## Output

The main functions in {cleanepi} return an object of type `data.frame` or `linelist`. The report made from all cleaning tasks is attached to this `data.frame` as an attribute and can be accessed using the `attr()` function in base R.
