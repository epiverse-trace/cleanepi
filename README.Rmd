**{cleanepi}** is an R package to clean, curate, and standardize epidemiological data. 

**{cleanepi}**  performs several data cleaning tasks that an end-user would anticipate to be performed on a cluttered dataset. These include standard tasks such as: removing duplicated and empty rows and columns, removing columns with constant values, replacing missing value strings with `NA`, ensuring uniqueness of uniquely identified columns, converting `character` columns to `Date` under certain conditions, etc.    
**{cleanepi}** can also standardize column entries into specified formats, calculates age (in years, months, weeks, or days) from a given `Date` column and a reference date.   
**{cleanepi}** expects input data in  a form of  data frame-like structure (`data.frame`, `tibble`, etc) or a `linelist` object and returns a processed data of the same type. It also returns an object of type `list` that reports the outcomes from every cleaning task.  

**{cleanepi}** is developed by  the [Epiverse-TRACE](https://data.org/initiatives/epiverse/) team at the Medical Research Council The Gambia unit at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (MRCG@LSHTM).


## Installation

The current development version of **{cleanepi}** can be installed from  [here](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/cleanepi).

```{r message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("pak")) install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("epiverse-trace/cleanepi")
library(cleanepi)
```

```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
library(cleanepi)
```

## Quick start
The main function in **{cleanepi}** is `clean_data(),` which internally makes call of almost all standard data cleaning functions, such as removal of empty and duplicated rows and columns, replacement of missing values, etc. However, each function can also be called independently to perform a specific  task. This mechanism is explained in details in the **vignette**. Below is typical example of how to use the `clean_data()` function. 

```{r eval=TRUE}
# READING IN THE TEST DATASET
test_data       <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "test_df.RDS",
                                       package = "cleanepi"))
print(test_data)
```

```{r eval=TRUE}
# READING IN THE DATA DICTIONARY
# test_dictionary <- readRDS(system.file("extdata", "test_dictionary.RDS",
#                                        package = "cleanepi"))
test_dictionary <- data.frame(options = c("1", "2"),
                        values  = c("male", "female"),
                        grp = rep("sex", 2L),
                        orders = 1:2)
print(test_dictionary)
```

```{r eval=TRUE}
# DEFINING THE CLEANING PARAMETERS
params <- list(
  remove_duplicates   = TRUE,
  target_columns      = NULL, 
  replace_missing     = TRUE,
  na_comes_as         = "-99",
  check_timeframe     = TRUE,
  timeframe           = as.Date(c("1973-05-29", "2023-05-29")),
  error_tolerance     = 0.5,
  subject_id_col_name = "study_id",
  subject_id_format   = "PS000P2",
  prefix              = "PS",
  suffix              = "P2",
  range               = c(1, 100),
  keep                = "date.of.admission",
  dictionary          = test_dictionary
)

# PERFORMING THE DATA CLEANING
res <- clean_data(
  data   = test_data,
  params = params
)

cleaned_data    <- res$data
cleaning_report <- res$report

# VISUALISE THE CLEANED DATASET
print(cleaned_data)
```

### Lifecycle

This package is currently an *experimental*, as defined by the [RECON software
lifecycle](https://www.reconverse.org/lifecycle.html). This means that it is
functional, but interfaces and functionalities may change over time, testing and documentation may be lacking.
