# cleanepi

**cleanepi** provides functions to clean epidemiological data provided in the form of a data frame or other related data type.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cleanepi from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r}
# install.packages("remotes")
# remotes::install_github("epiverse-trace/cleanepi@develop", 
#                         build_vignettes=TRUE)
library(cleanepi)
```

## Manual  
```{r eval=FALSE}
browseVignettes("cleanepi")
```

## Description
| function name | description |    
| :-------------- | :---------- |   
| **clean_data** | cleaning of column names, detecting and removing empty rows and columns as well as constant columns and duplicated rows. It also replaces missing values by NA and automatically convert date columns |      
| **check_subject_ids** | check whether the IDs comply with the expected format |    
| **standardize_date** | convert date column into _%Y-%m-%d_ |     
| **calculate_age** | calculate age from date column. Returned age can be in either _years_, or _months_, or _weeks_, or _days_ or a combination of some of these|    
| **check_date_sequence** | check whether the sequence of event dates is correct |
| **WIP** | work in progress |

The main function in **cleanepi** is `clean_data()`. It makes call of almost all the other exported functions, which can also be called independently to perform a specific cleaning task. 

Most functions **cleanepi** will return a list with 2 elements:   
1. the processed input data (could be modified or not)
2. a report object returned as list. 

## GENERAL DATA CLEANING
The example below performs the following data cleaning operations on the input dataset based on the following criteria:  

1. removal of any duplicated line across all columns (`remove_duplicates = TRUE`; `duplicates_from = NULL`)
2. replacement of the missing character `-99` by `NA` (`replace_missing = TRUE`; `na_comes_as = "-99"`)
3. conversion of any `character` column into `Date` if the 50% or more of its values turn out to be dates. Dates not within the specified time frame will be considered as outliers and replaced by `NA` (`check_timeframe = TRUE`; `timeframe = as.Date(c("1973-05-29", "2023-05-29"))`; `error_tolerance = 0.5`)
4. Checking if the subject IDs comply with the expected format (`subject_id_col_name = "study_id"`; `subject_id_format = "PS000P2"`; `prefix = "PS"`; `suffix = "P2"`; `range = c(1, 100)`). This will detect and remove the rows where the format of the subject IDs are incorrect.
5. The other cleaning operations, mentioned above, will be automatically applied to the input dataset. 

```{r eval=TRUE}
# READING IN THE TEST DATASET
test_data <- data.table::fread(
  system.file("extdata", "test.txt", package = "cleanepi")
  )

# VISUALISE THE INPUT DATASET
print(test_data)

# DEFINING THE CLEANING PARAMETERS
params <- list(
  remove_duplicates = TRUE,
  duplicates_from = NULL,
  replace_missing = TRUE,
  na_comes_as = "-99",
  check_timeframe = TRUE,
  timeframe = as.Date(c("1973-05-29", "2023-05-29")),
  error_tolerance = 0.5,
  subject_id_col_name = "study_id",
  subject_id_format = "PS000P2",
  prefix = "PS",
  suffix = "P2",
  range = c(1, 100)
  )

# PERFORMING THE DATA CLEANING
res <- clean_data(
  data = test_data,
  params = params
)

cleaned_data <- res$data
cleaning_report <- res$report

# VISUALISE THE CLEANED DATASET
print(cleaned_data)
```
Note that a function to visualize the report from the data cleaning will be built soon.  

## SPECIFIC DATA CLEANING TASKS
The examples in this section show how to use the individual data cleaning functions.

### CHECKING IF THE SUBJECT IDs COMPLY WITH THE EXPECTED FORMAT

Below, we will inspect for subject IDs with incorrect format, report them, but without removing them from the input data (`remove = FALSE`).    
The `report` argument can take a report object from the `clean_data()` function for example or another function in **cleanepi** that returns a report along with the processed data.

```{r eval=TRUE}
# DETECTING INCORRECT SUBJECT IDs
dat <- check_subject_ids(
  data = test_data,
  id_column_name = "study_id",
  format = "PS000P2",
  prefix = "PS",
  suffix = "P2",
  range = c(1,100),
  remove = FALSE,
  verbose = TRUE,
  report = list()
)

# VISUALISE THE REPORT
dat$report
```

### STANDARDIZING DATE COLUMN
This example shows how to convert a character column into date when it contains date values. 
If known, users can specify the date format in the target with the `format` argument. Otherwise, the function will automatically infer the date format and perform the conversion adequately.

```{r eval=TRUE}
dat <- standardize_date(
  data = test_data,
  date_column_name = "date_first_pcr_positive_test",
  format = NULL,
  timeframe = NULL,
  check_timeframe = FALSE,
  report = list(),
  error_tolerance = 0.5
)

print(dat$data)
```

### CALCULATE AGE

Given a date column column and a reference date, we can use the function in the example below to calculate individual ages in either years, months, weeks, or days.    
Note the creation of new column(s) in the output data frame.

```{r eval=TRUE}
# CALCULATE INDIVIDUAL AGES IN MONTHS USING TODAY'S DATE AS REFERENCE
dat <- calculate_age(
  data = test_data,
  date_column_name = "dateOfBirth",
  end_date = Sys.Date(),
  age_in = "months"
)

print(dat)
```

### CHECK DATE SEQUENCE

In this section, we are checking whether the sequence of dates is respected in the specified columns.    
Set `remove_bad_seq = TRUE` if you wish to remove the detected rows with incorrect date sequence.

```{r eval=TRUE}
good_date_sequence <- check_date_sequence(
  data = test_data,
  event_cols = c("date_first_pcr_positive_test", "date.of.admission"),
  remove_bad_seq = FALSE,
  report = list()
)

print(good_date_sequence$report)
```


## Next steps

* build function to display the cleaning report
* build function to perform dictionary based cleaning


### Lifecycle

This package is currently a *concept*, as defined by the [RECON software
lifecycle](https://www.reconverse.org/lifecycle.html). This means that essential
features and mechanisms are still being developed, and the package is not ready
for use outside of the development team.
